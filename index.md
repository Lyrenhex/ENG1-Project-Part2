# ENG1 Team Website

## Team Info
This project is being developed by Team 21Direction, formerly developed by Team mario.

The objective is to defeat all colleges. One college will be resistant, protected by a wall; defeat the other 3 colleges to break down the wall and complete the game.

Use WASD to move, and space or left-click to shoot.

You may encounter obstacles and disruptions to your plans as you explore the world, such as a violent Long Boi, storms, choppy waves (which will invert turning), and even some assistance from Charlie Jeffery in the form of a blessing to counter the perils of the lake.

Power-ups can be obtained through exploring the world (see above), or by purchasing upgrades from the in-game Shop for plunder.
