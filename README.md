## Testing

To run tests in IntelliJ IDEA, execute `Tasks/verification/test` within the Gradle pane.

To run tests via commandline: `./gradlew clean test`

To create new unit tests, see `src/test/java/com/lyrenhex/AssetExistsTests.java` for an example of how a unit test and a unit test class file looks. Tests should, where possible, mirror the `main` architecture, with `Test` appended to class names.
