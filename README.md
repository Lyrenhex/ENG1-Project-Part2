# ENG1-Project

The objective is to defeat all colleges. One college will be resistant, protected by a wall; defeat the other 3 colleges to break down the wall and complete the game.

Use WASD to move, and space or left-click to shoot.

You may encounter obstacles and disruptions to your plans as you explore the world, such as a violent Long Boi, storms, choppy waves (which will invert turning), and even some assistance from Charlie Jeffery in the form of a blessing to counter the perils of the lake.

Power-ups can be obtained through exploring the world (see above), or by purchasing upgrades from the in-game Shop for plunder.

## Testing

To run tests in IntelliJ IDEA, execute `Tasks/verification/test` within the Gradle pane.

To run tests via commandline: `./gradlew clean test`

To create new unit tests, see `src/test/java/com/lyrenhex/AssetExistsTests.java` for an example of how a unit test and a unit test class file looks. Tests should, where possible, mirror the `main` architecture, with `Test` appended to class names.
